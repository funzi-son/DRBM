Documentation & Tests
---------------------
- Unit-tests for models.
- Documentation with Sphinx.

Refactoring
-----------
- Merge optimiser classes.
- Replace "config" with "json" for configuration files.
- argparse or argcomplete in place of getopt.
- Debug/verbose modes to log various model parameters, etc.

Models
------
- RNN and Clockwork-RNN.
- Gaussian noise based regularisation.
- HDRBM with non-sigmoid activations.
- LSTM and GRU RNNs.
- RTNADE.
- Deep Transition models.
- Validation for unsupervised learning.
- Unsupervised RBM.

Features
--------
- Integration with Hyperopt and Sacred.
- Interrupt-save-resume functionality.
- Add multiple training loss function option in recurrent models, where
  applicable.

Other
-----
- Kaggle contest.

The following didn't work out, so don't redo them again:
- Replace params list with a dictionary for each of the models. This seems to
  have been accomplished in the Deep Learning Tutorials LSTM code. Re-visit
  this later as it isn't really such a big priority. The list is fine as of
  now.
